# Assignment4
My application is a simple python program to play a game of tic tac toe with two people
Each person takes turns picking a column and and row to match the coordinates of the board to fill in the spaces with "X" and "O"
The first person to make a line of 3 in a row in either a straight line or diagonal

How to run on windows:
1. right click on the Tic_Tac_Toe_A4.py file
2. select "open in terminal"
3. enter "python3 ./Tic_Tac_Toe.py"
4. enjoy!
